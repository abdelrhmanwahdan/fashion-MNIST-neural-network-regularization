# fashion MNIST neural network regularization
in this project I am analyzing cleaning and visualizing the Fashion MNIST data set then after that I am doing classification on it using neural networks with different regularization techniques to reduce overfitting by the following steps:
1. Data wrangling (Data gathering , Data assessing , Data cleaning).
2. Exploratory Data Analysis.
3. using different regularization techniques to reduce overfitting:
    - l_1 regularization .
    - l_2 regularization.
    - drop out regularization .
    - Alpha Dropout regularization.
    - MC Dropout regularization.
    - Max norm regularization.
